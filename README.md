a program written in python that gives climatic data 

The algorithm takes the information from the json data of the website of the daily newspaper the "Corriere della Sera" which own climate data of every city of Italy.

  ◾ Data
  ◾ Latitudine
  ◾ Longitudine
  ◾ Città
  ◾ Temperatura
  ◾ Temperatura suolo
  ◾ Umidità
  
followed by the graphs that show the variation of the temperature every 30 minutes (the variation it's purely constructed and not truthful, but calcolated in a realistic and credible way)
